# Story about the task

Imagine you work for a consultancy company, and one of your colleagues has been
doing some work for the Tennis Society. The contract is for 10 hours billable
work, and your colleague has spent 8.5 hours working on it. Unfortunately he has
now fallen ill. He says he has completed the work, and **the tests all pass**.
Your boss has asked you to take over from him. She wants you to **spend an hour
or so on the code** so she can bill the client for the full 10 hours. **She
instructs you to tidy up the code a little and perhaps make some notes so you
can give your colleague some feedback on his chosen design. You should also
prepare to talk to your boss about the value of this refactoring work, over and
above the extra billable hours.**

# What you should do

1. Fork the repo on GitHub at https://github.com/WayLit/refactor-test
1. Refactor the class "TennisGame1". The aim is to improve readability and
   generality, while still passing tests. Make sure you write good commit
   messages. You should use the language that you're most comfortable with. We
   are looking for ability to understand legacy code, write good code, and
   documentation.
1. Do not change the interface or tests. The test suite provided is fairly
   comprehensive, and fast to run. You should not need to change the tests, only
   run them often as you refactor.
1. Do not spend more than an hour or so.
1. Add section to the README.md about your changes and the motivation
1. Make sure you commit all your changes including README.md and push to GitHub
1. Send us the link to your repo.
